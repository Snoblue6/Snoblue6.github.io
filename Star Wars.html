            <p class="card-text">The Galactic Republic by the time of the Clone Wars had suffer many problems. A major one was corruption. Some planets eventually would try to to secede from the Republic as the CIS. This would lead to the current chancellor (Palpatine) taking
                emergency power (which he wouldn't relinquish when the war was done) given to him by the Senate. The Senate however unlike the Imperial Senate was more independent and less of a rubber stamping committee whose members however were not
                always elected to their post (Naboo, Onderon, Alderaan, and Mon Calmari). Some planets even opted out of the war (Corellia) with it not taking an active part of the Senate until the Clone Wars was over.</p>
